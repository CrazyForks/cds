      <description>To build CDS, the development team took their inspiration from the Continuous Delivery principles:
 The process for releasing/deploying software MUST be repeatable and reliable. Automate everything! If somethings difficult or painful, do it more often Keep everything in source control Dev Done means “released” Build quality in! Everybody has responsibility for the release process Improve continuously Build binaries only once Use precisely the same mechanism to deploy to every environment Smoke test your deployment If anything fails, stop the line  ref.</description>
