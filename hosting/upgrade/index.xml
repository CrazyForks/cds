      <description>CDN service The release 0.48 introduced a new CDS service called CDN. This service is dedicated to receive and store CDSâ€™s job logs.
We created this service to be able to move out job&amp;rsquo;s logs from CDS database to an object storage provider (more information about this list of providers here).
In this release, logs are stored both in CDN storage units and CDS database to facilitate migration. Old log data and database table will be removed in a future release.</description>

      <description>CDN service The release 0.49 introduced a new parameter in CDN configuration to disable and remove a CDN unit. In the previous version 0.48, you migrate log from CDS to CDN, by adding a temporary CDN Unit here. Time is coming to disabled it. In the next release (0.50), all logs datas in CDS will be deleted, and CDN will become the only way to manage logs.
Disable CDS Unit Add in your cdn configuration, the property &amp;ldquo;disableSync = true&amp;rdquo; for the CDS Unit</description>
